General
=======
* What about user feature packs. Is that something we will support?
-- MAYBE for WildFly, but probably not for EAP?

Docker image
============
* Needs the tool jar, and the server-image-builder, which is just the pom.xml
- Run the tool to update the pom.xml
- Run the maven build to provision the server and create the image
* How to name the image?
* Once built where should it be pushed to?

Later
======
* Metrics about how it is running - we need to know who is using what
-- Where is this stored?

Done
====
* Use processing instruction in the pom.xml to be replaced with the eap.xml contents
* Add CLI files in known location in the jar
* YAML as an alternative to CLI configuration
* Pick out latest WildFly Galleon Pack from universe
-- cloud and datasources Galleon packs also use latest version in GAV
* Schema and typed parser for the server-config.xml
* Override base image, wildfly feature pack location and cloud/ds feature pack versions via env vars
-- I don't think we want to make this easy for users?
-- But it seems useful for staging of new images/devs who need the multiarch image etc.
* Override wildfly galleon pack location via env var (I don't think we want to make it easy for users to do this)
- Think it is important for staging/trying old versions etc.
